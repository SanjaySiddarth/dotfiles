# 🛠️ My Dotfiles

This repository contains my development environment configuration for macOS and Linux. It includes setup for:

- 📝 Neovim (kickstart.nvim fork)
- 🎹 Karabiner (macOS)
- 🎛️ KMonad (Linux)
- 🖥️ WezTerm
- 🐚 Zsh
- 📁 Yazi
- 📦 Eza
- 🍺 Homebrew (macOS + Linux)

All configurations are managed using [`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for clean, modular symlink management.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each top-level folder is a `stow` package. Inside each, the structure mimics the destination path (e.g., `~/.config/nvim`).
